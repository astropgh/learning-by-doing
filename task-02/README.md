# Task 2: [git] Syncing a fork

*prerequisites*: [Task 1](../task-01)

## Steps

1. Add the `astropgh/learning-by-doing` repository as a remote repository called `upstream` for your forked repository (i.e., `yourusername/learning-by-doing`).
2. Pull `upstream/master` into your master branch, and then push it to `origin`
3. *(The rest is similar to Task 01)* Checkout a new branch called `task/02`
4. Add your GitHub username to `task-02/completed.md`
5. Commit your change to `task/02`
6. Push `task/02` to your fork
7. *(Optional)* Submit a pull request

## Food for thought
- What's the difference between a fork and a clone?
- What's the difference between `origin` and `upstream` in this case?
- What's the benefit to work on new branches like `task/01` and `task/02`, rather than on `master` directly?
